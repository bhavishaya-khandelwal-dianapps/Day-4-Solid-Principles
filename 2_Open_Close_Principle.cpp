// The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you should be able to add new functionality to a class or module without changing its existing code, thus reducing the risk of introducing bugs or breaking existing functionality.

// Real-life Example: Payment System
// Imagine you're building a payment processing system for an e-commerce platform. Initially, the system supports only one payment methodâ€”credit card. Over time, you want to extend it to support multiple payment methods, like PayPal and Bank Transfer. Using the Open/Closed Principle, you'd design the system in such a way that adding new payment methods doesn't require changing the core payment processing code. Instead, you'd extend the system by adding new components.
